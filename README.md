# Trie-Map-Node
An assignment I completed for COMP 1406. I implemented a trie data structure that uses recursion to store string keys and their associated string values. A trie (or prefix tree) is a tree based data structure that stores key/value pairs. I applied my knowledge of data structures and recursion.
